### File format

First line is a number, indicating how many tracks there are The coordinate is
in integer, real wire and dummy wire alternates, with a cut between a real wire
(R) and dummy wire (D). A track always starts with a real wire at coordinate 1

### Example

In the following, a wire, either Real or Dummy is represented as

	a-X-b

where a and b are some integer with b > a, X is either R or D, e.g.,

1-R-10 means a real wire at [1, 10]

	3 50			// 3 tracks, length = 50
	10 30			// 1-R-10 C 10-D-30 C 30-R-50
	8  22 35 40    	// 1-R-8 C 8-D-25 C 25-R-35 C 35-D-40 C 40-R-50
	12 20 37 42 	// 1-R-12 C 12-D-20 C 20-R-37 C 37-D-42 C 42-R-50
